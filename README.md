# About me
## Interests
I'm really into computers, videogames, mountain biking, programming, and anything else that's fun!  I absolutely love biking! There's nothing better than riding a bike to relax.  My second favorite thing is designing and programming video games! It's really creative and inspiring. And last but not least, computers! I recently bought a computer and built it myself, and I absolutely love it!
### Wedsites I Recommend
I highly recommend this website to build your own computer: PCPartPicker. It is the best and most intuitive site out there.  [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/)
I highly recommend Opera GX for its excellent interface and display of browsers. It is the fastest browsing experience I've had.
